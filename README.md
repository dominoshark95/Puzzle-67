# Puzzle-67
I am a Python developer who has written a code to solve the Bitcoin Puzzle 67, and I am sharing this code here. I look forward to receiving your financial support. Thank you.

This code automatically searches the specified ranges in Puzzle 67 and then performs the necessary calculations to generate the private key. It converts the private key to an address, and whenever the private key corresponding to our address is found, it prints it in the console.

One of the features of this program is the ability to save search progress, so if the program is interrupted, it can resume the search from where it left off. Additionally, the range is divided into four sections to make the search process faster.
